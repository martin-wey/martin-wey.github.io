Here is just a page to share drumming pictures. I have been practicing this instrument for more than 13 years and I could now not imagine living without playing and composing drums. Playing drums is always a unique and important moment for me that allows me to dive into a deep connection between my body (physically and cognitively) and the music! I hope you enjoy these few pictures :blush:

Here is my beautiful and dream drumkit. For the curious, it is a Pearl Masterworks Carbon kit. The sound is absolutely stunning both in the studio and for lives!

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/drums_overview.jpg" title="drums" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

A global view in the same room with the +25 recording mics :dizzy_face:
On the right, a picture from behind the kit with the music sheets (good in case of memory lapse)

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/drums_in_studio.jpg" title="drums in the studio" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/sheets_from_the_kit.jpg" title="reading sheets" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Finally, a picture behind the kit during a show
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/behind_the_kit.jpg" title="behind the kit 1" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

A last one just for the fun and because music makes me so happy! :smile:
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/behind_the_kit2.jpg" title="behind the kit 2" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
