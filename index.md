<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am a Research Scientist at [Singapore Management University](https://computing.smu.edu.sg) (SMU), where I focus on advancing large language models (LLMs) for software vulnerability detection. I am a member of the [Centre for Research on Intelligent Software Engineering](https://rise.smu.edu.sg) (RISE).

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [DIRO, University of Montreal](https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/home/), under the supervision of [Prof. Houari Sahraoui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xsUkTCEAAAAJ&hl=en). During my Ph.D. studies, I was awarded two prestigious scholarships through competitive selection: a Google Scholarship for Excellence and the FRQ Merit Scholarship for Foreign Students in Canada. My research during this time focused on understanding and fine-tuning LLMs for code generation and analysis. I also spent time as a visiting researcher at SMU, collaborating with [Prof. David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/) on topics related to lifelong learning for code LLMs. My academic foundation includes a master’s degree in data science and a bachelor’s degree in computer science and mathematics from the [University of Namur](https://www.unamur.be/en).

My expertise is situated at the intersection of **deep learning**, **natural language processing**, and **software engineering**, with a special emphasis on **LLMs for code analysis**. My work aims to better understand how LLMs process and generalize from code, uncovering insights into their emergent capabilities and improving their adaptability to dynamic coding environments.
