My research is about applying deep learning and natural language processing in software engineering. 
Specifically, my thesis topic focuses on exploring the area of continual learning and out-of-distribution generalization for pre-trained language models of code. 
It involves developing novel techniques and architectures that enable pre-trained language models to learn continuously in non-stationary environments while also improving their ability to handle out-of-distribution scenarios. 
This could have significant implications for various applications of code analysis and generation, including software development, code maintenance, and debugging.

My main research interests include deep learning for code, continual learning, out-of-distribution generalization, large language models, and program synthesis.

Besides, I enjoy reading about other research topics including psychology, neuroscience, and, deep reinforcement learning. In my free time, I play and compose music.
