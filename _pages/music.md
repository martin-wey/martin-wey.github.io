Here is just a page to share drumming pictures. I have been practicing this instrument for more than 13 years and I could now not imagine living without playing and composing drums. Playing drums is always a unique and important moment for me that allows me to dive into a deep connection between my body (physically and cognitively) and the music! I hope you enjoy these few pictures :blush:

Here is my beautiful and dream drumkit. For the curious, it is a Pearl Masterworks Carbon kit. The sound is absolutely stunning both in the studio and for lives.

A global view in the same room with the +25 recording mics :dizzy_face:

And, a picture from behind the kit with the music sheets (good in case of memory lapse)
