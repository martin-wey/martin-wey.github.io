<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Operations Research at the [University of Montreal](https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/home/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Houari Sahraoui](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~sahraouh/index_eng.html). From October 2022 to January 2023, I was a visiting Ph.D. researcher at [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/), working with [Prof. David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/). Prior to this, I obtained my master's degree in data science and a bachelor's degree in computer science and mathematics from the [University of Namur](https://www.unamur.be/en). 

My research lies at the intersection of **deep learning**, **natural language processing**, and **software engineering**, with a special focus on large language models (LLMs) for code intelligence. Specifically, my thesis revolves around understanding and efficiently adapting LLMs for software coding tasks. My first research objective is to investigate the intricate training dynamics of LLMs when exposed to code, aiming to enhance our comprehension of phenomena such as emergent capabilities in LLMs and generalization. The second aspect of my thesis involves exploring data-centric applications related to out-of-distribution generalization and lifelong learning for LLMs applied to code. This encompassess studying scenarios where important distribution shift of the data may impede the effectiveness of LLMs and how to adapt LLMs to new codebases over time without forgetting prior knowledge.
