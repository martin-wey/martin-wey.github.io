I am a PhD student in the Department of computer science and operations research at University of Montreal advised by <a href="https://diro.umontreal.ca/repertoire-departement/professeurs/professeur/in/in15076/sg/Houari%20Sahraoui/">Prof. Houari Sahraoui</a>.
I am part of <a href="https://geodes.iro.umontreal.ca/">GEODES</a> software engineering research lab where I carry out my research projects. 

My research focuses on the application of deep learning and natural language processing in software engineering. As part of my current research project, my objective is to design data-driven approaches to build efficient recommender systems to assist different stakeholders involved in the development and the maintenance of complex software systems.

In particular, as part of my PhD thesis, I am interested in building multimodal learning systems to better modeling software and build more efficient recommender systems.
