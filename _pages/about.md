I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of computer science and operations research at the University of Montreal advised by <a href="https://diro.umontreal.ca/repertoire-departement/professeurs/professeur/in/in15076/sg/Houari%20Sahraoui/">Prof. Houari Sahraoui</a>.
I am part of <a href="https://geodes.iro.umontreal.ca/">GEODES</a> software engineering research lab where I carry out my research projects. 

My research is all about the application of deep learning and natural language processing in software engineering. As part of my current research, my objective is to design data-intensive approaches that can be leveraged to ease the development and maintenance of complex software systems by assisting developers.

The objective of my Ph.D. thesis is twofold. First, it involves the design of **multimodal learning approaches to better modeling programs**. Secondly, I believe that making **deep learning models of code adaptable and robust** to adversarial situations where important distribution drift of the data occur is crucial. Therefore, my second objective is to study the resilience of deep learning models of code to these scenarios, and design methods to improve their robustness.

Besides, I enjoy reading about other research topics including psychology, neuroscience, and, deep reinforcement learning. In my free time, I play and compose music ([check out this page!](/music)).
